## Who you are
Leaving aside all that existential fuss about “who you really are”, we’re looking for a passionate front-end developer to be a part of our team developing a new product. Do you know the secrets of world-class UI solutions? If you’ve got the following skills, you may be the Warrior we’re looking for:

* Experience of web app development
* Interested and even experienced in mobile UI
* Passion for new technologies and trends
* Experience of being nice and an ability to laugh are not obstacles to join our team

## What you’ll do
Seriously, I have no slightest idea. I’m just a poor copywriter who doesn’t understand a thing about all these terms, so I’ll just vomit these words here: UI, Javascript, Enyo, NodeJS, HTML5 and CSS.

## What we’ll offer
* Great chances to improve your skills
* Vibrant company culture
* Family-like work environment in Oulu or Espoo (your choice!)
* Well it is too obvious, isn’t it? Money!

## How to apply
Do you think our dreams could merge? Would you like to unleash your full potential with us? Can you imagine yourself as a part of ZEF family?

Please, come and join our excellent international team! Send an application with a link to your GitHub profile or other portfolio to markku.alasaarela@zef.fi and we’ll be in touch sooner than you think! See ya!
